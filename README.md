# AlgoLib
Simple C++ algorithms library
In progress...
Feel free to add some reasonable implementation of algorithm or data structure here.
This library is intended to be used for competitive programming or just
puzzle solving for fun, so usage is as simple as including one header and interface
is minimal. Example usage provided in clients and some input data presented.
